# Bringing Deep Learning to Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)

In this repo you will find information on running deep learning tasks such as training and inference on [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/).

* [Distributed Deep Learning Training on Amazon EMR](./training-on-emr): Provides step by step instructions to setup EMR cluster with [AWS Deep Learning AMIs](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/) and run distributed deep learning training on the cluster.

* [Distributed Deep Learning Inference on Amazon EMR](./mxnet-spark): Shows how to run distributed offline inference on large datasets using [Apache MXNet](http://mxnet.apache.org/) (incubating) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) on Amazon EMR.
